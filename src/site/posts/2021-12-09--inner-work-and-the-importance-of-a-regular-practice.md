When I was little I went to a nursery run by Maria Dolores, a vegetarian lady that was really into yoga, meditation and spirituality, which in the early 80's wasn't as cool as it is now, but rather considered a bit crazy and out there, specially in a little Spanish village in them middle of nowhere.

I don't remember a whole lot, as I was only four or five at the time, but I remember she would grate tomatoes to make us all tomato juice as the first course of our lunch everyday. I also remember sitting in meditation and feeling the energy of the sun going into my body through my fingers. It's funny how something I did so many years ago would end up having so much meaning in my life later on.

As I grew up, I forgot all about how much I enjoyed meditation  and being in touch with a deeper part of my self, but in my late teens and early twenties in order to find relief to my existential angst I rediscovered my love for meditation and yoga as well as spiritual books and it's been with me pretty much ever since.

Having practices and activities that nourish my inner self and help me connect to the self that lives inside are absolutely crucial to me in order to feel like I'm not going crazy. The way I see it living a life with those anchoring practices, is a life devoid of depth and real meaning and one that leads to a lot of the problems that we now call bad mental health.

It may be perhaps different for people that have well adjusted early lives devoid of trauma, but for anyone that has experience outer turmoil I would make it a cultural norm to prescribe some quiet alone time as it's amazing how much your inner self wants you to know.
