Our addiction as a society to having things the way we want them to be or expect them to be is one of the biggest sources of suffering in rich countries. 

Who was going to tell us that achieving such level of comfort and convenience, in which we can have virtually anything at our fingertips, would make us so unhappy. 

You may not think it does, but getting used to having what we want can be bad for our mental health. And by that I mean that in a capitalist society that means having to pay for the things we've got accustomed to having with money.

We've basically have been primed, slowly but surely, to want the things that others want us to have, lately it's what big corporations want us to have. They make the rules about what's a good life, what kind of person you need to be in order for you to be happy with yourself. So we've basically have outsourced the design of what a good life is to us to these businesses and corporations. In this moment in time when we could be at the pinnacle of freedom, we check out and let them decide for us. 

But it comes at a price as to have a chance to play the game you need money. That's where it gets tricky, because now you need to go to work, sometimes in something you don't like, to get money, to pay for the dream they've sold you. 

The whole thing is skewed because you're going to work in a job you don't like, to make money so you can buy things you haven't even thought through if they're what you want. You're just following the herd and the directives of government and corporations that are making the rules that we all live by. Wake up.
