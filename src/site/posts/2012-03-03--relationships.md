I'd like my second post on my blog to be about relationships. Romantic relationships. Everybody wants one, most have one at some point or another for a longer or shorter period of time, what really what makes a relationship with a partner worthwhile? what makes it last?

I think being nice helps, and helpful and thoughtful and calm…but as a wife myself I know all those things to be difficult to achieve at times. I wonder why… Is it that sometimes knowing someone so well and being so close to them, makes you feel like you've got a right to judge them and (shhhhh) boss them around? Unfortunately, in my case it does, but I'm really, really, really trying to be a better wife everyday and hopefully my husband will stick around while this never ending learning process takes place!

Being nice, seems like a fairly easy thing to do, but don't you find that sometimes it's much easier to be nice to a shop assistant or a colleague at work rather than to your own familyI I seem to go to such lenghts to “sell myself” to people as this cheery and helpful person but seem to care little or nothing about how my behaviour affect my loved ones. Please help!

So I'm setting myself the quest of in the next for days be nicer to my husband and my mum (which is here visiting at the moment). Will I be able to manage my moods for the next seven days?

At least I'm hoping it'll be a good exercise to learn about what sets me off and what thoughts are the ones that are most dangerous, because at the end of the day, my moodiness starts with a simple but very negative thought.

So everyone! My challege this week is to carry a little notebook, in which I'll write everytime I'm moody with someone and a brief explanation of why I thought that was ok to do. I'll be back to report and let you know how I did.
