> If you want to be less stressed begin by realising that you carry around your own set of preconceived notions how things should be. It is best on those notions that you assert your will to resist what already happened< Michael Singer, the Untethered Soul

The preferences, likes and dislikes that we have been acquiring and curating since we were born are what make us stressed. We put those against what is happening in front of us at any given moment and then we get stressed because the two don't match.

It's not life events that are causing us problems or stress but our predilection for different outcomes. We basically want life to go our way and if it doesn't, we stress. Try it next time you feel stressed, is it some ideal that you're trying to attain which doesn't match the current reality of what is actually happening? Most times you'll find that it is.

It's not life events that cause problems or stress but your resistance to life's events. And in our entitled world, where we're so used things going our way this is more of a problem than ever. We want the world to be our way, all day, every day or else we pledge to be irritated, judgemental and unhappy.

To change this predicament, we need to first realise that this is something we're doing internally and stop blaming the outside world for our unhappy feelings. Secondly, we can use the things that happen to us in life to let go of those preferences, those likes and dislikes. We can become more like when we were children and anything made us happy as we had much less preconceptions on what we needed to be happy.

Next time you feel stressed, ask yourself if there's anything you could let go of, which would allow you to feel lighter, happier and less stressed.
