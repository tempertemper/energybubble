title: Breaking through the barrier
intro: It's funny how the biggest barriers and boundaries in our lives are inside of us.

We like to complain that they're outside but really if we stop and think they're well and truly entrenched inside of us and even a small degree change can feel like climbing a mountain.

I find that my emotional habits and routines are so weighty inside me that it takes a lot of work to keep myself in check so that they don't just end up running my life and taking me to the exact same place that I've always been.

We all like to think that something outside ourselves would totally change how we feel inside, because it's so much easier to think that, than to face our emotional baggage that so dearly we cling to. 

There's a little voice inside my head, I'm sure you've got it to, that every now and again, whispers to you something you could do that would be exciting and amazing to do. But every time the voice of my past self, my emotional habits and comforts swiftly kick in and start listing all the reasons why that wouldn't be a good idea...to go with it, my heart gets scared by the unknown, by the idea of not knowing what would happen if I dared act on that whisper.

We're programmed to seek comfort at all costs. To seek security but if we're honest with yourself that security and comfort makes us feel bored out of our minds and castrates our innate urges for adventure and growth. 

Let's listen more to that whisper and let's follow its instructions, because as the saying goes: -'A ship in harbour is safe â€” but that is not what ships are built for'.
