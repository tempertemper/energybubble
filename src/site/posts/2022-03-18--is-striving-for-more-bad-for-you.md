I am always looking for something to make myself feel better. All the time, I'm looking for a change, for something else. For not now. Not this. Surely my happiness could be anywhere else but right here.

Every day, I set up on the journey of trying to look for what 'that' thing that will finally make me feel complete and settled would be.

I wonder if this is a modern problem. We live in a time in which, we all want to be stars in some area of our lives, and so a regular life is really just not enough. We all want to be more, have more, achieve more. To be exceptional.

Has this always been a human issue, has it always been like this? Have we always been so dissatisfied with who we are, where we live and how much money we have?

I really don't know the answers, but I know this much... it's painful to live my life in this way, always striving for more, for better, for 'not here'. It devalues the present moment.

The only answer I have been able to find to help me just appreciate where I am in any given moment is meditation and mindfulness.

The simplicity of just sitting and being aware of where I am. Being grateful for every single thing that it's going right in my life, rather than focusing on what's missing.

Because the chances of us having everything we ever wanted at the same exact time is pretty slim. And even if we did, we would find something else that was missing.

So is a good life not one that strives to be aware of everything that it's right with our lives and to cherish the present moment, rather than always looking at our lives through the dark lens that wanting more and more represents? For me, it definitely is.

Namaste
