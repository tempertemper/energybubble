Life's purpose - What is my life's purpose? What is the meaning of my existence? Ask yourself this question:

> What is it in this planet that needs doing that I know something about, that won't happen unless I take responsibility for it?

--- Jon Kabat Zinn

The reason why more and more of us are struggling to find meaning in our jobs but in general in finding our place in the world is because we've been sold a model of self servitude, in which, our needs and desires come first, they're the most important thing, hedonistic pursuit is the absolute number one value in our current western culture and has been for some time, but as we've now reach pretty much the highest point in that pursuit and more a more of us are finding ourselves empty, listless and devoid of any real meaning is because in reality we're not separate beings, we're all part of a beautiful whole, all part of the dance of nature, the universe whatever you like to call it, we're all part of it, and not separate from it. So when our primal desires have been sidetracked onto being all about getting 'me, myself and I' sorted something is at odds, and the current mental health epidemic is a sign of it. We're not separate from each other, and from our environment, we need to start realigning our core values, we're not fucking consumers. We're amazing beings cooperating with each other to make the most of this amazing trip that we call life. But to bring it back to something a bit more tangible, more doable, something that you could start doing today what about if we all pretended to be working for humanity as an employee of the universe at large?
