'Nobody cares what you look like.'

They care about what THEY look like and whether they look better than you or not. That's the only reason they may be paying attention to your appearance. It's just their ego at war with itself inside their heads. You don't want to play the same game by making that the purpose of your life. You don't want to spend hours and hours, trying to find the best outfits, applying the best makeup and going to gym for hours as the only thing you're doing by investing time in those things is nurturing and feeding your ego.

We're so far removed from who we really are that we've been tricked into thinking that our value is determined by how thick our hair is, how white our teeth are and how expensive our clothes look. But nothing can be further from the truth. Tending to those things only feeds your ego and will only impress other people kidnapped by their egos. It'll lead you astray.

What happens when you feed your ego? The same thing that happens when you feed anything in life, it grows, and it thrives. If I only know one thing about life, it is that you really don't want to be feeding your ego. The more the ego grows, the more space and time it takes off your inner experience; the less space is left for your real self.

Your real self is the only one that can provide you with the true happiness that we're all looking for, as it's the only part that it's true. The ego is a mind game, a veil of thoughts covering your true essence.
