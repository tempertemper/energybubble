One of the main reasons why we suffer is because we're constantly trying to get reality to match up to what we've made up in our heads that it should be. 

The assumption that the world should be exactly how we've imagined it should be is one of the biggest traps that our egos lays in front of us. 

How many aspects of your life have you designed in your mind? The type of person you need to marry? How many kids you'll have? What the right house is, how much money you should have, what career etc. 

We all do it, and it's the accepted way of operating, specially in our western, capitalist society that prides itself in fulfilling our every whim and desire. But does it make for a healthy relationship with reality?

What happens when reality doesn't match up to what we've imagined? We label it as wrong, unfair or bad...but is it really so? Or is it just a mismatch between what our minds have made up and what reality presents to us?

Reality doesn't play games. Reality just is. Take it or leave it. And if we want to play mind games with it, chances are we will suffer. 

But what if there was a different way to relate to the moment in front of us. What if we could actually experience whatever is in front of us, fully aware of the moment, taking in all of its nuances and quirks. Not wanting it to be anything different. Accepting internally every bit of it. 

The alternative, is to lay a thin veil over it. A veil of expectations, wants, desires and the choice to see reality through that lens therefore covering it up and missing it completely. Doing this, not only, doesn't allow us to see it for what it is but it means that we miss its vibrancy and unlimited beauty.
