Don't hide on your children. Don't put them up as an excuse not to do what you know what you should do. Let go of mother's guilt. It's a trap. You should be doing what your heart wants you to do.

Do you know how much damage that can do to them? And to yourself? It could deem the whole relationship toxic and undo all the good work that you've done so far. 

Do your thing...pursue your dreams. Be a psychotherapist, make videos, write blogs, practice yoga, dance, go and visit friends. Thrive. Show your children what being alive and happy means in practice. Do it to make sure you don't betray yourself, because you'll be betraying them in the process.

Start by paying attention to every moment of your life. Don't rush it. Take your time, savour it as every moment of your life has a holographic kind of effect, how you experience and which attitude you approach life with will become the pattern for all the other parts of your life. Doing the things in your life, as if they were a song to the universe, is what brings happiness.

Doing things to the best of our ability matters not only to us but to the good of everything and everyone around us.
