Dear Elena,

There's something really important that you need to know, that I wish I had known when I was growing up. You're not your thoughts. The mind creates thoughts, like it does dreams at night, but that's not who you are. Who you really are is the consciousness that is always there witnessing all the thoughts that the mind creates but you're not what the mind produces. 

Understanding this will free you from most problems that you'll face in life. You need to find regular times in your daily routine to connect to your real self. I do it every morning. I make tea. I sit with a book and a notebook and I connect to my essence. To what's underneath everything. 

Your real self is what religions call God. It's the part of you that is whole and pure, that is not tarnished by preferences, likes and dislikes. It's the part of you that just experiences the present moment and then let's it go, so it can be empty for the next moment. The real you doesn't judge. It just witnesses. It's the bit of you that it's ok with everything that happens because it doesn't prefer one thing over another. 

If you ever get lost in your mind, which will happen. There's another way to go back to connecting to your real self. The present moment, anytime, anywhere you are, just close your eyes and feel your aliveness in that moment and when the thoughts try to invade your mind just quietly come back to the moment you're in. Right here, right now be present and experience freely and openly what it's in front of you without letting your mind label it as good or bad. And right there you can find yourself everytime.
