    I'm a new mum, and it's bloody hard work! Why did nobody ever told me that this little being was going to turn my world upside down… So much for the baby guides that teach you about what do you need to do next in your pregnancy, exercise, decorate the nursery or pack your back for the hospital… what about get your head around the fact that your life is over and you're about to become a slave to a baby.

I'm a new mum, and it's bloody hard work! Why did nobody ever told me that this little being was going to turn my world upside down… So much for the baby guides that teach you about what do you need to do next in your pregnancy, exercise, decorate the nursery or pack your back for the hospital… what about get your head around the fact that your life is over and you're about to become a slave to a baby.

Anyway, so they don't tell you… maybe it's a bit like with the pain in labour that with time you forget how tricky it was to actually get used to your new life. Or maybe it's that people are afraid to say that they're not coping, because there's a bit of a hidden pressure I feel to present the perfect motherhood picture that appears on the baby product adverts.

Well, I'd like to say, I'm not coping! I've tried very hard but as time goes on, and now baby is 8 months, the less I cope, the backlog of sleep is really getting to me and I can of miss my old life… I guess it's not accepted to say that in some ways you wish that never happened but secretly sometimes I do…

My husband has been at me for a while to start this blog, and I really didn't feel I had the energy, but I think sharing my path will give me the energy I need to keep going. For all mother out there that are struggling, for all mothers that feel their life is in tatters, this is for you and for me, so that the burden it's not so heavy if we carry it together, so that we can see light at the end of the tunnel.
