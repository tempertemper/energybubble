Is there anything positive to take away from this crazy hiatus we find ourselves in? I think so.

> Pain is the price of freedom, and the moment you're willing to pay the price, you'll no longer be afraid

– Michael A Singer, The Untethered Soul

Every news story, every conversation, every social media feed; coronavirus is rightly front and centre. It's a scary, unprecedented time, but I want to take a minute to offer a different perspective in the lockdown the virus has brought with it.

It strikes me that this moment in time, as well as scary, is unique. I has the potential to act as a reset button!

The world has almost stopped turning; the busyness and motion of life has come to a halt. We could look at it as scary and unsettling but it can also be seen as the biggest opportunity that we've had in modern times to take stock and reflect on the meaning of what we're doing. Without distractions, this is our best chance to create change.

Think about it – when was the last time as many humans had this much time to reflect? I believe we've got a great opportunity on our hands in which there isn't that much going on (personal circumstance permitting; I know not everyone is the same).

So here's an idea, instead of trying to block this time out by indulging in distracting activities like Netflix, the news, or consuming extra alcohol, why not consider blocking out some time every day to do a little introspection. To look at where we were at and decide if there's anything that we could change when all of this has passed and normal life resumes.

This could be a massive opportunity for humanity to rethink its direction. Imagine we all took a bit of time without the distractions that marketing and modern life in general throw at us to really dig into what really matters to us.

I'm planning to take thirty minutes a day to introspect and decide if the way I was living my life was what it should have been, or whether I was doing a lot of things because of the inertia of the culture around me. I'm excited to see what comes up!
