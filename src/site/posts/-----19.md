I guess the short answer to this question is: clarity. Clarity is one of my biggest assets, without it, I feel like I would look at the world through a dirty window.

Let's be honest, life can be both: beautiful, exhilarating and empowering but it can also be hard, brutal and unfair. I need to be totally on in order to make a success of it. You can't just turn up, make a half arsed attempt at it, and hope that it succeeds. Life requires vision. Vision to know where you're going and why you're going.

Because of this, in my view, the ability to cultivate clarity at all times is a super power. It gives you the ability to see things as they really are. Not through a hazy filter but with clear and sharp focus. And it allows no bullshit to sneak into your life.

Alcohol and any other drug taking blunts the most important tool I possess. I understand they have de-stressing qualities but, for me, the amount that they can throw me off course doesn't pay off.

I like to be able to see clearly the good and the bad in life. It teaches me stuff, it helps keep myself accountable and on course. Without the training of daily struggles I wouldn't be able to see all that life is, where the right path lies and then follow it. Which to me is the meaning of Life.
