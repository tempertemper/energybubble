As humans, after all our primary needs are met, all we ever do is try to feel love. Every action, every way we choose to do things has been curated over our lives by our egos to try and feel love and joy.

But what if we’ve been going about it totally the wrong way? What if instead of changing ourselves, in the hope that the world will recognise us as valuable and give us the love we primally crave, what if instead we could develop practices and routines in our daily life that could unleash the love that is inside ourselves which is a million times more abundant that the one we can beg outside ourselves (and let’s be honest, sometimes it really feels like begging!)

So, what would those practices entail, what would they be? Much has been spoken about meditation or any other activity that can help us quieten the constant chatter that is in our minds. Those disciplines which ever ones you have found that put you in that state where you can just about make the ego-mind shut up, are the ones that will take us to the place that we want to be when it comes to getting love.

If you haven’t found a particular activity that does for you, I strongly recommend you have a look at meditation as it’s the ultimate tool to help with our predicament.

There’s something about getting the outside quiet enough so that we can see the duality that lives inside our minds. We’re so identified with our thoughts that we think we are them. We have made our life long constructed egos tell us who we are but when we get quiet we realise that the thoughts (about who we are, what job we do, how many times we’ve been married etc) are just that, thoughts, but that there’s another dimension inside our brains that is capable of watching those thoughts, those mind objects that seem so real to us. Something else overseen them and that something is the doorway to feeling more love because that is the real you, and the gatekeeper to unconditional love and happiness, but there’s a catch, that love and happiness can only be experience in the present moment, in the now, in the moment that you’re able to stay behind the thoughts and not to follow them like we usually do.
