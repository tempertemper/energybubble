I'm the one that gives you energy. Walk with me and you'll never be tired. I am the one that sustains you, walk with me and you'll hardly need any food. We can do things together you never thought were possible.

But there's only one place you'll find me. Only once place where we can be together. You may remember, it's where you lived as a kid, just here, just now. Nowhere else can you feel my presence.

If you're not present and with me, your experience it's just your mind tumbling over itself. When you realise you've left the present, just notice and come back to it. There's no judgement or shame in it. Just another train leaving the station. Take it every time you've noticed you got off it.

Every human goes through the same predicament. It's like a small technical glitch of the mind, to trick you into believing that you're it. But you're not the mind, you're the being using the mind to experience the world. You're in charge.

Come back to me, to you. We're the same. Do it every time. That is your only job in life. The rest will take care of itself. You'll know what to do, not much to work out in advance. The journey's next step can only be revealed just after the one you've just taken. And only when you're present to listen to the instruction.
