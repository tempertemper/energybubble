title: Where there's no space, nothing new can be created
intro: Busyness and the way most of us rush around doesn't really allow us to connect with our creativity and with who we really are.

Busyness and a full schedule doesn't make very fertile ground for good creative ideas. You must realise that what you're fearing most, what your busyness is keeping you from needing to confront is the most valuable thing you have.

Have you not noticed, that all the best laid plans and activity that the mind creates never makes you feel truly fulfilled. There's a momentary relief of the pain, but it's far from the joy you know it's possible.

That joy can only be achieved by understanding that the joy can only come from the space inside you. It's that vacuum, that nothingness which has the key to what you're looking for. It can't be found by gazing and focusing on objects.

Your real self is the empty space that lies inside you. That empty space can only be felt and truly experienced when you get your mind to suspend thought. That's why meditation is a useful tool. Because it allows us to see that we're not the objects that our mind chooses to hold in it. We're the being-ness, the consciousness that notices the objects. That distinction is the doorway to our true selves. Without that understanding we're puppets for our minds to do as they please with us.
