title: Are you able to witness everything and hold on to nothing?
intro: When we hold on to the status quo, we move away from our true path. To be fully in the present moment is the only way to live a truthful life.

Life wants you to be brave. To be brave enough to hold the present moment. To hold all of its contents and let it just pass by you. Like as if you were made of vapour, just witnessing the content of the present, not holding it in any way. 

Getting rid of the tiny internal hooks that want to hold tight to some experiences. Getting rid of the urge to reject the experiences our psyche decides are not desirable. Being the receptacle of the experience, and when the experience is over, letting it go, going back to being the empty receptacle.

Life wants you to be brave. To be a soul that is ready to hold the present moment without wincing or fighting. To remain still, unfazed by the present, just being the container of it that keeps its essence until the next moment appears.

That is the key to a joyful life. Everything else is just running away from the fact that we can't control our lives. By  trying to control them we're putting a thick coating around us that prevents us from feeling who we really are and our experience of life. It feels safer as we're somewhat cut off from the full experience of life but it also creates a sort of numbness engulfs us and makes us feel detached.

Trust life, trust the present moment. There's nothing to fear. Don't settle for the manufactured reality that is your psyche, with its capricious likes and dislikes. Fall being thought if you want to find yourself.
