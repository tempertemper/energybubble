We live in a culture that worships more.

More money 

More followers 

More fun 

More information 

More stuff 

Everything is always aimed at thinking about how we can be more, achieve more, and have more stuff. It's our culture's default, and we've become conditioned to see it as the most positive use of our time here on earth, but is it?

Perhaps when we're thinking as the system as a whole, the capitalist system, the one we're all worker bees in, then maybe more is always better as it allows it to always become bigger and bigger. The worship of more serves the system well. But what is the cost to us, the individual, to always be focused on more? 

I believe that always being focused on achieving more is in part responsible for the rising rates of depression and anxiety that we see today, specially on western cultures and other cultures that have, largely, their basic needs met. 

Could it be that constant striving for more is not only killing our planet and our mental health but it's also totally meaningless? A bit like a hamster on a wheel that is really, really busy pushing hard at the job at hand but actually it's always in the same spot. Nothing much to show for all that effort. Perhaps that is exactly where we are when we're so fixated on more. 

You may ask yourself, but then what? What should I pursue instead? Being on the constant hunt for more is all I know...

From my personal experience, looking inward and discovering that I'm much more than my lustful mind is the only way out. Using whatever path or technique to deepen my spiritual path is the only way I know to find that peace and fulfilment. It seems a simplistic solution but it's the only one i've been able to find. Achieving indward, instead of outward. 

More consciousness

More light

More space

More silence

More peace

I would love to live in a culture that worshipped less outward gains and more inward ones.
