title: Fall behind thought to know who you really are
intro: The reality of who we are has nothing to do with the personal traits that we've been taught make up our identity. It's about something deeper.

The reality of who we are is totally different to what we've been taught we are. The personal traits that we have made our identity has nothing to do with the reality of the power that lies behind them.

The self is only a collection of thoughts over time. We've been collecting thoughts about who we are. People tell us from when we're little what our character is like, and what we're like compared to our brothers and sisters. All of these comments compound over time and create a very compacted and solid mental image of who we are. But it's definitely not who we are. 

The mirror shows us an ever changing image which we amalgamate into our mental idea of what our physical self looks like, what the film the Matrix called Residual Self Image and again we make the assumption that that's who we are. Is our sense of self just a bunch of thoughts and sensory perceptions that we've been collecting and cataloguing since birth?

Or are we something much ethereal and ever changing than that. Are we the awareness that is witness to those thoughts, memories and general projections about ourselves? What would happen if we stopped believing in those thoughts about who we are...Would we disappear? Cease to exit? Or would the consciousness that sits behind those thoughts always remain?

What would happen if we stopped believing in those thoughts? What would happen if we believed different thoughts about ourselves? We would probably look different to the outside world, we may dress differently, or have different behaviours to fit the new identity we had conjured for ourselves.

But the real question is what would happen if we went one step further from the thought. What if we could be the space behind the thoughts, the power that creates those thoughts. Would operating from that  place not be a more permanent representation of who we really are? Be the space that receives the impressions from the thoughts. That never changes. It's the only place to feel the peace you're yearning for. We are that place. The space behind the thoughts. Go there often to find joy.
