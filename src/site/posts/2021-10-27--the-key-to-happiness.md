> To begin with, you have to realise that you only have one choice in this lifeâ€¦Do you want to be happy, or do you want to not be happy? It's really that simple. Once you make that choice, your path through life becomes totally clear.

--- Michael Singer, the Untethered soul

What would your life look like for you if you decided to be happy no matter what happened? If you decided that the way you feel about life, your happiness, was not going to be determined by what happened that day but a rather a commitment you made to the day.

Practising staying open at all times, it's the ultimate happiness hack and the only way to experience life with our shrivelling every time something happens throughout the day which your mind labels as bad.

When you think about it, making such a decision would end all your problems literally. Because you would decide so. Problems are only problems because we label them as such in our minds.

Choosing to stay happy no matter what, is quite a radical act, which is simple but not easy. However it's the only rational and intelligent thing to do as otherwise your day, and your life, are full of landmines that could set you off into the path to unhappiness.

Instead of trying to avoid the landmines of life, which is what we do on a daily basis, choose the path of unconditional happiness. In order to succeed, however, you will have to make sure you remain centred, as the automatic pilot will tell you it's a good idea to close and be unhappy when something you don't like happens. But persevere in your aim and remain open. That will take you to the happiness you've been waiting for.

As Michael Singer says, the key is to learn to keep your mind disciplined enough so it doesn't trick you into thinking that what ever is happening in front of you is worth closing over. There are different techniques you can us to keep the mind disciplined and centred, meditation is one of them but there are many others that may work better for you, use whichever one works best to keep you on track.
