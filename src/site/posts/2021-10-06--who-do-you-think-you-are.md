> You need to let go of who you think you are to be come who you really are.

â€“ Michael Singer

Who you think you are is for the most part who you've been told you are since you were born, you think you are male or female, you think you are a certain age, and come from a certain socio economic status and from a certain country and culture, that's how we generally describe ourselves in a conventional way.

But is that really who we are? As if we had born in a different country, family even perhaps gender maybe we would say we were someone completely different if were were using that definition.

I think that definition on who we are is more likely to be the map we've been using to navigate life, the rules and regulations we have used to make sense of the complicated landscape of reality. Some maps are better than others, or I should say work better than others at directing you through the world, and some are more applauded and liked by others but I wouldn't assume that that is who you really are.

What about you were the awareness that can see that map, that can describe it and that is like a blank page in which your particular map has been pencilled onto, but it's not the actually writing on it.
That's who I think we really are. I think we're the awareness behind our likes, dislikes and other programmed behaviours that are determined by the blueprint that the map represents.

Let's look at it from a different angle, what about if who you think you are, on close inspection, can only be found on a thought, about your past and and your future and about all the elements that you think you need to have to be a good one of your kind. And what about if who you really are can't be thought, it doesn't exist in your mind but it's an awareness that you can feel only here and now. Does that make sense. Who you think you are lives in your mind and who you really are lives here in this moment only.
