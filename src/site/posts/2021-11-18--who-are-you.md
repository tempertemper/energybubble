Your personal self is like a collection of pebbles, rocks and gravel that you've been acquiring along the path you've walked since you were born. Your personal self, against what you've been taught all your life is not who you are. If your path had been different then you would have picked up different pebbles, rocks and gravel along the way and you would be a totally different person, but your essence, the jar that holds the pebbles, rocks and gravel, always remains the same. That's who you really are. You are the consciousness that witnesses what this body and mind are going through in life. 

You're the background in which life happens. So it doesn't mean your body is not real or that the physical life you live is not real, but it does mean that you can always take a step back from all of the life around you and get in touch with your real self. Peace and joy are always possible in that place. That place is always available to us. Knowing that it's there it's the most important thing I've learnt so far.

Opening up that doorway on a regular basis and getting acquainted with that part of yourself allows you to overcome shortcomings and limitations that only exist in the personal mind. The personal self can only use the mind to work out what the best outcome is, but it's always limited by which pebbles, rocks and gravel you've picked up so far. The real you beneath it has access to many more resources that are not tied to the mind. Creativity and genius come from that place. 

Task of the day: Just for today I will take time to get to know my real self. I will find a quiet place and I will seat in peace freeing myself from the thinking mind.
