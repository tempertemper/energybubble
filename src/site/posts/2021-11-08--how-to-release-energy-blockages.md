> The stuff that holds you down periodically rears its head. When it does, let it go. You simply permit the pain to come up in to your heart and pass through.

---Michael Singer, The untethered soul

Have you noticed that there are emotional patterns that come up again and again? Like, perhaps, when you're driving and someone cuts you off or is driving too slow. Every time that particular situation happens it sends you into an emotional response without you having any say in it, it just starts as if pressing play on a song.

For me, it could be bigger things like when my husband is not being responsive enough. My fear of abandonment, will start playing and without noticing I start to act irrationally and erratically because the hurt I felt when my dad left and my life went on a tailspin is replaying again and it's now taken over me.

What is that about then? Why is it that certain situations totally make us react in ways that we would never choose if we were fully in control. In spiritual terms, we talk about these imprints as Samskaras or energy blockages. At some point in our lives, something has happened and we haven't processed its emotional charge properly and it has stayed trapped inside our psyche.

We all have them, there's no two ways about it. The difference is whether you feel ready to take a deep dive into yourself and find the root cause of the blockage or you don't. When you're ready the way to do it, is to find a quiet place, where you can have peace and quiet. You then get ready to replay the primary situation when you stored the pain. You go deep into the details of it. You then feel its emotional charge fully. You'll probably cry and sob but this is ok, the more emotion you let go here the better.

It's important to not label the emotion as it's passing through as negative, just to let it pass. To allow it. To not fear it. Just let it go. You can do this once for smaller Samskaras, like generally the driving ones are, or may need to revisit it a few times if it's a big one, like the abandonment fear in my case. That one took at least three or four sessions spaced out by a few weeks.

Hope this helps explain a bit more how to release energy blockages. Let me know if you have any questions on Twitter.
