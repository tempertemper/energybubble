Have you noticed that in the western world, where we're all free to do as we please (within the boundaries of the law) we're all more lost than ever? I'm not saying freedom is not good, because it is, what I'm saying is that navigating all that freedom takes a lot of work.

Think about other times and other cultures in which rules are bountiful; they mark the path quite clearly, and so working out whether you're going in the right direction is easier. These are rules that have been set up by the ancestors of that culture, and so you find some comfort in the fact that these guidelines have been tried and tested.

I'm not saying that societies with rules are better than the ones in which individuals are able to choose from a much broader array of possibilities, as I don't think that's the case. However, what I do know is that working with my inner self in such a rudderless path is a full time job.

I find myself constantly in a battle with what I should be doing versus what my lazy body and mind want to do. It's an endless struggle. Sometimes you can get yourself into a good routine that works which tames the inner voice for a while, however, something always happens, you get ill or have to go travelling and your routine gets disrupted. You're back to square one. And that's exactly what I'm talking about, the constant changing nature of life and the lack of real structure makes life sometime like an uphill struggle. 

Don't get me started when it gets to food, as we all know that this presents another huge battle that we fight daily, specially in the last few decades when corporations have made our environment explode into an obese fest. 

Do you struggle with keeping yourself in check? What tech ices do you use to make sure you're able to follow a good and healthy life? Or are you struggling and just find the whole thing and mountain impossible to climb? Let me know on Twitter @energybubble
