I'm in love with my phone. I don't want to let it go off my sight. I want it next to me. I want to stroke it, look at it, learn everything I can from it. It seems like the perfect partner.

It provides everything I could ever want. If I need to socialize, it connects me with friends, family members and strangers that may share similar interests. If I'm bored, it amuses me. If I need any type of information, it helps me find it. If I feel sad, it can cheer me up by showing me funny videos or photos of good times past. It can even help if I'm after some raunchy material. What else could I want from a partner, a best friend, a lover. 

This is how I feel about an object made of glass, plastic and metal, and I'm not entirely sure how it got here, but I find it really hard not to look at it, play with it, handle it. It takes all my might to put it down. 

But even though it fulfils all of those needs, it does it in a way that feels wrong. Like some sort of toxic relationship that you crave, but you know it's terrible for you. I don't like it, but I don't know how to create a healthy relationship with it. 

Do you have any ideas for me? Any tips or tricks that you have used to try and become less attached and addicted to your phone? Help me out and let me know on Twitter @energybubble please!
