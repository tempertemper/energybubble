'The purpose and meaning of my life is for me to create a clear path between me and my soul. So that its power and beauty can help me be as much of my authentic self as possible.'

We're all scared of being ourselves. Our culture doesn't encourage authenticity as it's not good for business and the economy. It's not an easy to manage quality. We all compromise our true selves so we can get on better in the world. But is getting on enough? Or does it  leave us feeling a bit empty and sad inside.

I believe we all yearn to show who we really are to others. But we hesitate...as we're all fearful that we'd be ostracised and rejected if others could see who we really are. But the thing is we're all hiding in plain sight and I believe that reluctance to show up aunthentically is why there's so much emptiness and discontent in our culture.

Our culture gives us a pre-programmed set of personas and cookie cutter templates of the types of people we are allowed to be, and is up to us to fit ourselves in one of those peg holes, to choose the one that better approximates to who we are. But we resent this, deeply as it means that we have to go through our existence trying to suppress the aspects of ourselves we don't think are acceptable.

So how could I try to be more myself. How could I stop trying to fit in with everyone else?...in my case, I love spirituality but I don't often talk about it as I feel I'd be labelled as a hippy or just a plain weird person. See how it works?

So I invite you to join me as I intend to be myself more today. To not be closed to interactions and conversations that open up that side of me. To tell more people about this blog and what is about, so i can show the world my light. To dare to be seen as a fool, because the alternative than to just blend in and resent the world for it, and this journey we're in is far too amazing to go around feeling resentful.
